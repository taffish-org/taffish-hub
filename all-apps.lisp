PyMOL is a source-available molecular visualization system created by Warren Lyford DeLano.

> We provide normal command line mode and GUI mode for pymol, for users who need GUI please get pymol:v3.1.0.gui, and for users who only need command line, you can only get pymol:v3.1.0

## pymol:v3.1.0.gui -- Use gui of pymol in your browser

For the gui mode, we do it together with [noVNC](https://github.com/novnc/noVNC) through VNC, which makes it possible to access the gui version of pymol through a browser, as shown in the following tutorials:

### 1. Run the following command on the CLI:
  
  ```bash
  taf update
  taf install -y pymol:v3.1.0.gui
  # restart terminal or [$ source ~/.bashrc] or [$ source ~/.zshrc] ... 
  taf-pymol-v3.1.0.gui --c {docker/podman} --passwd 12345678 --port 5801
  # --c only support docker and podman, chose yours              [default container]
  # --passwd will be used when you try to connect the gui        [default 12345678]
  # --port will be used when you try to connect the gui          [default 5801]
  #        it will only be set once when you first run taf-pymol
  ```

### 2. Check the output and the URL

  Wait for the run to finish, check for errors, and if everything is fine, look at the end of the output, you can get a web address, for example:
  
  ```
  >>> pymol-GUI ===> http://localhost:5801/vnc.html <<<
  ```
  
  Copy the URL and open it in your browser to access pymol-gui:
  
  <img width=\"1448\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fac4efc9-377a-4ddc-af7e-8b9295a33067\" />


### 3. Enter the password and enter the GUI interface (the password is the --passwd set at runtime, the default is 12345678)

  <img width=\"1449\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7babc62-b53f-43a1-b8fe-72a27329ab53\" />

  
### 4. Open the terminal in the GUI and enter pymol to open pymol in the GUI interface

  <img width=\"1448\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff73fb1c-2646-485c-99c6-33d4475bf76d\" />


### 5. Use pymol-gui

  Note:
  - By default, the /root/ path in the container needs to be retrieved from the global path /home/$USER
  - For the remote server, you can change the localhost in the URL to the server IP to access the pymol-gui on the remote server
  - Only a single screen is created for the same port/container service, and different accesses share the same screen. If you want to start a new service, please open a new docker/podman container(use another user to run taf-pymol-v3.1.0.gui) and select a new port")
